    on debian-devel mailing list.

tk8.6 (8.6.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Make tk8.6-doc replace tk8.6 because of moving the
    /usr/share/tcltk/tk8.6/demos link.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Sep 2013 20:23:15 +0400

tk8.6 (8.6.0-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Removed unnecessary patch to tkPort.h.
  * Make libtk8.6-dev depend on tk8.6 for better backward compatibility.

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Aug 2013 21:25:44 +0400

tk8.6 (8.6.0-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Renamed tk8.6-lib and tk8.6-dev packages to libtk8.6 and libtk8.6-dev
    because the latter is a much more common naming scheme.
  * Added conflict with older tk8.6 to the tk8.6-doc package (a link to
    Tk demos was moved from one package to the other).
  * Fixed the maintainer 'name'.

tk8.6 (8.6.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bumped debhelper compatibility version to 9.
  * Added multi-arch support. This includes splitting out the tk8.6-lib
    library package with libtk8.6.so and tkConfig.sh moved into a
    multi-archified location.
  * Recreated /usr/lib/tk8.6/tkConfig.sh for backward compatibility (intend
    to remove in the future).
  * Removed .0 suffix from the libtk8.6.so library in order to remove
    unnecessary diversions from the upstream practice, provided the symlink
    for backward compatibility (intend to remove in the future).
  * Switched to calculating dependency on libtk8.6 via a symbols table.
  * Don't use the alternatives mechanism for selecting /usr/bin/wish. This
    package ships only /usr/bin/wish8.6. The tcltk-defaults package provides
    the necessary symlink. This also means that tk8.6 does no longer provide
    the wish virtual package.
  * Moved the old changelog to the tk8.6-doc package to reduce size of the
    tk8.6 one.
  * Moved the Tk demos to the tk8.6-doc package.
  * Fixed clean target in debian/rules.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.4.

    tkConfig.sh configuration script.

    dependencies list.
